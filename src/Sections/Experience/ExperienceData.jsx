    description: "My first foray into the professional tech landscape, this internship marked the beginning of my real-world development experience. It was a journey that started with aspirations and despite being swamped with coursework, a part-time job, and endless studying, I was determined to gain some tangible, real-world experience. After an intense period of applications, coding challenges, and countless learning moments, I secured my role at Walk With Web. Here, I engaged in a full-stack environment, contributing to both the design of the database and the development of web applications. While front-end development tested my skills, I discovered a passion for back-end development, which I hope to pursue in the future."

My tenure here was highly rewarding; I had the pleasure of meeting incredible people and am eternally thankful for the guidance and support of my manager. The experience was also eye-opening, as it exposed me to the user-end challenges of software usability, often finding myself frustrated with the inefficiencies of poorly designed systems.
