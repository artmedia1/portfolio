      "Fresh out of high school, I found myself at a crossroads, unsure of which academic path to take. With limited guidance from family and school, traditional fields like engineering or computer science seemed daunting. My high school volunteering experience at a pharmacy had already steered me away from healthcare. So, I took a gap year, during which my uncle helped me land a job as a CNC Operator. Although the job was straightforward, I didn't see it defining my future. Eager to explore further and still pretty young, I decided to dive into academia, but the question was - in what field? I chose something tangentially related to my job experience – starting with CNC programming and eventually pivoting to industrial design. It turned out to be an enlightening journey. I not only made great friends but also immersed myself in learning, eventually graduating on the president's honour list. It was a period of significant personal and academic growth, setting the stage for my future endeavors.",

      "Riding on the wave of newfound confidence from my diploma at Seneca College, I aimed higher and embarked on pursuing an engineering degree. My childhood and teenage years were filled with a fascination for computers - tinkering with settings, solving system issues, dealing with virus infections, and setting up game servers. This deep-seated interest led me to York University. The reality, however, hit hard. The subjects were more complex, the math intensely challenging, and the large class sizes of 500+ students were a stark contrast to the 20-30 I was accustomed to. Personal attention was scarce, with professors swiftly moving through topics. Doubts crept in as I struggled with basic HTML and felt overwhelmed in my first data structures class. 'This is basic stuff,' I was told when seeking help, pushing me into countless hours of self-study. Witnessing the dropout rate and seeing class sizes shrink back to familiar numbers, I often wondered if Computer Science would have been a better fit. Despite the hardships and the steep learning curve, I persevered, gaining a deeper understanding and appreciation of my field.",
